The Fermi datasets are splitted into different energy ranges.

Each energy range is to answer a specific question. check the questions in your google drive presentation

The dataset of each energy range has a different configuration (accordingly to the question I want to answer).

The configurations are described in the google slides. On top of the different energy datasets, it is also splitted into different time binning. 

For each dataset, energy range, time bin, there is a specific configuration file, which is inside each folder. 

you need to run GTAnalysis. What is a good strategy is: run GTAnalysis in screen section over night

After that, you need to run gtpsf also on terminal to get the PSF cube
